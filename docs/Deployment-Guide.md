# Deployment Guide

Implementing your own Beacon instance allows you to share genomic and phenotypic data securely, facilitating global data discovery and collaboration. Here's a streamlined guide to help you set up your Beacon:

## 1. Understand the Beacon Protocol

Familiarize yourself with the architecture of the Beacon specification, the structure of the Framework and the schema of the Data Model. 
> [Beacon Documentation](docs.genomebeacons.org)

## 2. Choose your implementation approach
There are several ways to implement a Beacon v2 instance, depending on your resources and expertise:

- **Full Implementation**: Develop your own REST API that adheres to the Beacon v2 specification, connecting it to your internal database.

- **Utilize Existing Tools**: Leverage available software solutions and reference implementations provided by the Beacon community to simplify deployment.

## 3. Set up your internal database

Ensure your genomic and associated phenotypic data are stored in a structured format compatible with the Beacon v2 data model and define your filtering terms.  This organization is crucial for seamless querying and data retrieval.
> ***Note***: If using the CRG Beacon v2 Production Implementation (B2PI), this step is already handled. B2PI includes built-in support for data structuring, requiring only configuration of its components.

## 4. Set your security and privacy parameters

Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control data access, ensuring compliance with ethical standards and regulations. 
> ***Note***: Security and privacy mechanisms are integrated into the B2PI, reducing the setup effort to configuring the necessary components.

## 5. Test your Beacon instance

Before going live, rigorously test your Beacon instance:
- **Validation Tools**: Use the Beacon Verifier to ensure your implementation meets the required specifications.
- **Community Feedback**: Engage with the Beacon community for insights and potential collaboration opportunities.

## 6. Deploy and maintain

Once tested, deploy your Beacon instance and monitor its performance. Regular updates and maintenance are essential to align with evolving standards and to incorporate new features.
