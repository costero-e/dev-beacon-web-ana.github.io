# GA4GH Beacon project

The GA4GH Beacon is an open, **global standard** for discovering biomedical data across diverse domains. It allows institutions to make their datasets findable and facilitates **federated data discovery** across a network of independently operated Beacon instances - each responding to standardized queries while retaining local control. Beaconâ€™s **extensible data model** accommodates a wide range of data types, from genomic variants to clinical data and metadata. Researchers can either check for the presence of a genomic variant (Yes/No response) or gain more detailed information through **structured queries**. Beacon v2 supports **flexible access controls** to meet project needs and legal requirements, either by keeping access public or define who can see what, and under which conditions.
